                    When a man becomes a father, his roles multiply. Not only is
                    he responsible for himself and the mother of his children,
                    but he is also given the ultimate responsibility of raising
                    another human life. This requires that he learn to wear many
                    different hats and wear them well. Here are 5 important but
                    easily overlooked roles of a father.

                    By looking at how our kids see us we learn something about
                    ourselves! Primary school kids in the US were asked to
                    describe what makes a good dad. They came up with the
                    following:
                    <br></br>“A good dad makes you feel safe”
                    <br></br>“A good dad can protect his children from getting
                    hurt”
                    <br></br>“A good dad knows how to keep the bad guys away"
                    <br></br>“A good dad always listens to Mum”

                    Over 90% of resident fathers, those who live with the childs
                    mother, were reported to be highly involved in prenatal
                    activities and experiencing pregnancy for dads, such as
                    discussing the pregnancy, viewing the ultrasound, or
                    listening to the babys heartbeat. Yet, there is a lot to
                    being a dad for which there is no formal preparation.

                    Fatherhood comes with responsibilities such as:
                    <br></br>Authority figure: Fathers have the responsibility
                    of being authority figures, which helps ensure his child
                    learns how to solve problems.
                    <br></br>Remain trustworthy: During teenage years, fathers
                    have the responsibility of establishing and maintaining a
                    reliable figure. Fathers might gain their teen’s trust by
                    being patient with them during these years.

                    I wouldn't sacrifice my family time and flexibility for any
                    pay raise or career advancement. I love my job and what I
                    get to do at work every day, but it needs to be able to
                    co-exist with the people who are most important in my daily
                    life. If my work did not allow me to be the kind of husband
                    and father that I want to be, I would definitely have to
                    consider restructuring my job or working arrangement.

                    All children need positive guidance and discipline, not as
                    punishment, but to set reasonable limits. Dads should remind
                    children of the consequences of their actions and positively
                    acknowledge desirable behavior. Fathers who discipline in a
                    calm and fair manner show love for their children.

                    Children whose fathers are involved in their daily care such
                    as feeding, bathing and playing together, tend to be more
                    confident; and, as they grow older, enjoy stronger social
                    connections with peers. Research shows secure attachments
                    have positive benefits that last into adulthood. Children
                    who are securely attached do better academically; they are
                    also more sociable and well-liked throughout early childhood
                    as compared to children who do not have secure attachments.

                    Fathers, like mothers, are pillars in the development of a
                    child's emotional well-being. Children look to their fathers
                    to lay down the rules and enforce them. They also look to
                    their fathers to provide a feeling of security, both
                    physical and emotional. Children want to make their fathers
                    proud, and an involved father promotes inner growth and
                    strength.

                    Science tells us that the relationship between a father and
                    child deeply impacts a child's long-term development in many
                    critical ways. Young children with involved fathers tend to
                    be more patient and better able to handle stress and
                    frustration once they're in school. Dads who are present and
                    involved from birth are more likely to stay involved
                    throughout their child's life. Children with involved
                    fathers are less likely to experience depression, obesity,
                    teen pregnancy and more.

                    For many men, raising kids means that they need to make
                    self-improvement and self-care part of their purpose. After
                    the birth, “It was no longer acceptable for me to simply go
                    through the motions,” said Blake Overbay, a sergeant with
                    the Massachusetts Army National Guard. “I had to outwardly
                    demonstrate that I was working to better myself.

                    Through almost every studied culture, fathers have assumed
                    three primary roles: the protector, the provider, and the
                    disciplinarian. Before we discuss each of these roles, it is
                    important to note that in many two-parent families today,
                    mothers are fulfilling these three roles as much as fathers.
